# Enclosure-and-Comparable-interface

An interface called "Enclosure" should contain two abstract methods: 

"perimeter" which takes no argument and return the perimeter of the enclosed shape as a double. 

"area" which also takes no argument and return the area of the enclosed shape as a double.

Two classes: "Circle" and "Square". Both classes should implement the customized "Enclosure" interface and java’s built-in “Comparable” interface. Create 
an appropriate constructors, getters, and setters for the class "Circle" and "Square".
